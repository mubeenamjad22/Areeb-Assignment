                    On July 26, 2018, Khan was elected Prime Minister despite many people accusing Khan's campaign of
                    rigging the election.[16] Khan took oath as Prime Minister of Pakistan on 18 August 2018.[17]

                    On April 3, 2022, he told President Arif Alvi to dissolve the National Assembly after a
                    no-confidence motion against him failed.[18] However, four days later on April 7, the Supreme Court
                    later said what Khan did was illegal.

                        arguments and their relation to the different aspects of life. It may not be the case with
                        everyone but those who are spiritually minded and has an idealistically realistic approach
